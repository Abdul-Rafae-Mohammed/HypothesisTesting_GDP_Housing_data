# HypothesisTesting_GDP_Housing_data


In this project, I applied Hypothesis-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter 
before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom to find out whether University Towns are affected most by the 
recession or the Non-University Towns.
